## How config files work:
Place config files in this directory.<br><br>
Each config file should be named as the serial number for the device for which it belongs.<br>
The file extension for each config should end in .set<br>
Each device config must be in the Junos set format (set commands).

#### File/Folder structure:
configpy-node/junospyez-ossh-server-master/configs/CV1417AF0163.set

#### Real world example:
File name: <br>
CV1417AF0163.set

File content: <br>
set system host-name test-device-1
